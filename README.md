## About 
Hi, I am Briti. I am a *PhD Scholar* at CESP,JNU. 
My areas of interest include **labour economics, climate change, unemployment and inequality.** 
I strongly believe in supporting one's arguments with data hence I am trying my hands on in coding. Enthusiastic to learn R and and to embed the codes in org mode.
Hoping to contribute more in the days to come.
